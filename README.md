# Psychographic-Clustering-of-TV-Audience
We are assuming we have sufficient numbers of tv viewers across India who are willing to be a part of our panel and giving their psychographic data. An appropriate amount of cash/goodies will be provided to panel members every month to keep them motivated. BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council), India, has already started such an initiative. The privacy of the panel members is our primary concern. So, all the methods mentioned in the presentation does not infringe the privacy without the users' permission

We have described the methods to collect the psychographic data of panel members more effectively. This data is useful in the psychographic clustering of the consumers. This clustering can then be used to analyze what kind of people are watching what type of TV channel at what time.
